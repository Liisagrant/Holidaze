# Holidaze 🏠

## Description 📝

Holidaze is a modern front-end accommodation booking application, developed as a final exam project at Noroff School of Technology. The project's goal is to create an Airbnb-like platform where users can browse various accommodation options to book their stay, or register as venue managers to create and manage their own rental properties. The project uses an API provided by Noroff, for which the documentation can be found [here](https://docs.noroff.dev/).

3. 🏷️ A user may view a specific Venue page by id
4. 🗓️ A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
5. 📧 A user with a noroff.no email may register as a customer

7. 📅 A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
8. 📧 A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a Venue manager

10. 🔄 A registered Venue manager may update a Venue they manage
11. 🗑️ A registered Venue manager may delete a Venue they manage
12. 👀 A registered Venue manager may view bookings for a Venue they manage
